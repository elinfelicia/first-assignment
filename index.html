    <h1>Introducing our Pets</h1>
    <h2>Tintin</h2>
    <div id="tintin">
        <div id="tintin1">
            <img src="/images/tintin01.jpg">
            <p>This young man is Tintin. He is an adorable Imperial Shi-tzu who stays
                with us every other week.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div id="tintin2">
            <img src="/images/tintin02.jpg">
            <p>He is not a fan of physical excercise, or staying awake for that matter.
                Most of the time you can find him exactly like this. Fast asleep.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div id="tintin3">
            <img src="/images/tintin03.jpg">
            <p>He is, however, a big fan of attention. Which would result in most of my 
                working days looking something like this. 
            </p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <h2>The Fish</h2>
    <div id="fish">
        <div id="frank-frances">
            <img src="/images/frank-frances.jpg">
            <p>This is Frank and Frances. They are as beautiful as they are fertile and 
                viciously mean to all the other fish in the tank.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div id="ffbabies">
            <img src="/images/frank-fry.jpg">
            <p>They never stop having babies in a tank that does not have the capacity for that.
               They truly make me wish neutering fish was a thing one could do. 
            </p>
        </div>
        <div id="dennis-denise">
            <img src="/images/dennis-denise.jpg">
            <p>And this stunner here is Dennis <i>(top)</i> and his wife Denise <i>(bottom)</i>. They are 
                well-behaved, with no babies, and they used to rule the tank before Frank and Frances moved in.
            </p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <h2>Honorable Mentions</h2>
    <div id="llamas">
        <div id="phil-pedro">
            <img src="/images/phil-pedro.jpg">
            <p>This is Phil <i>(left)</i> and Pedro <i>(right)</i>. Unfortunately they had to be left behind
            in Tokyo when I moved back to Sweden, and they are currently staying with a close friend. 
            They were sent to me to Tokyo from Amsterdam. Unfortunately Phil, being a hollow, ceramic llama from Amsterdam,
            had his back legs brutally smashed by customs officers on his way over. 
            He gets by with prostethics made of cardboard. <br> A real trooper. </p>
