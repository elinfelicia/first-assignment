                    <p>This young man is Tintin. He is an adorable Imperial Shi-tzu who stays
                        with us every other week.

                    <p>He is not a fan of physical excercise, or staying awake for that matter.
                        Most of the time you can find him exactly like this. Fast asleep.

                    <p>He is, however, a big fan of attention. Which would result in most of my 
                        working days looking something like this.

                    <p>This is Frank and Frances. They are as beautiful as they are fertile and 
                        viciously mean to all the other fish in the tank.

                    <p>They never stop having babies in a tank that does not have the capacity for that.
                    They truly make me wish neutering fish was a thing one could do.

                    <p>And this stunner here is Dennis <i>(top)</i> and his wife Denise <i>(bottom)</i>. They are 
                        well-behaved, with no babies, and they used to rule the tank before Frank and Frances moved in.

                <p>This is Phil <i>(left)</i> and Pedro <i>(right)</i>. Unfortunately they had to be left behind
                in Tokyo when I moved back to Sweden, and they are currently staying with a close friend. 
                They were sent to me to Tokyo from Amsterdam. Unfortunately Phil, being a hollow, ceramic llama from Amsterdam,
                had his back legs brutally smashed by customs officers on his way over. 
                He gets by with prostethics made of cardboard. <br> A real trooper. </p>
